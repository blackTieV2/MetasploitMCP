Complete script to clone, build, and install Claude Desktop on Kali Linux properly, assuming normal user execution:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm git

# Install electron-builder globally
sudo npm install -g electron-builder

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian.git
cd claude-desktop-debian

# Run the build script as normal user (do NOT use sudo for this)
./build.sh

# Install the generated .deb package
sudo dpkg -i ./claude-desktop_*.deb

# Fix missing dependencies if any
sudo apt --fix-broken install -y
```

Save this as `install_claude_desktop.sh`, then run:

```bash
chmod +x install_claude_desktop.sh
./install_claude_desktop.sh
```

This will handle everything step-by-step, respecting the build scriptâ€™s requirement to **not run as root** while installing system packages as needed.
